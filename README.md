# CS-370-14254-M01 Current/Emerging Trends in CS Porfolio

- Briefly explain the work that you did on this project: What code were you given? What code did you create yourself?

The purpose of this project was to develop an intelligent agent capable of finding the most
optimal path to the treasure within a treasure hunt game.
The code that was provided included a class called `TreasureMaze` which represented the environment, including a maze object implemented as matrix.
Additionally, there was a class named `GameExperience` which stored a memory of all game states between the start and end of a given game.
There was also a Jupyter notebook provided which contained the necessary library imports, initial variables, and several helper functions.

The code that I was responsible for was contained within the `qtrain` function. This function was where the maze environment and game experience
objects were initialized. Also within the function was the logic to conduct the Q-learning algorithm to train the AI agent.

- What do computer scientists do and why does it matter?

Computer scientists apply programming, math, engineering, and the scientific method in an attempt to advance human knowledge and develop solutions to real-world problems.
In doing so, they are able to develop algorithms, ideas, and technologies that directly impact all areas of life. This includes the medical, educational, industrial, financial, and agricultural sectors.
Many consider our current point on the universal timeline to be the "Digital Age", much to the thanks of Computer Scientists and forward-thinkers of all types.

- How do I approach a problem as a computer scientist?

When I approach a problem, I first do a thorough analysis of all aspects of the issue. I walk through a series of questions.
What is known about the problem? What is unknown? What are the constraints? Who is this problem affecting? Is there a clear way to define a resolution to the problem?

Once the problem is scoped out, I start to research possible solutions. Is there an existing solution? If not, are there similar solutions to related problems?
What is the most straightforward or "brute-force" way to solve this problem?

After an initial working solution is developed, next comes optimization. How can this be made more efficient? What about the solution is repetitive or unecessary?

By following this series of steps, I am able to usually come up with solutions to most solvable problems.

- What are my ethical responsibilities to the end user and the organization?

My ethical responsibility to the end user is to ensure that the solutions I design are reliable, secure, and respect their privacy. Users trust that the software they interact with will function as intended without exposing them to unnecessary risks, so it is important to prioritize safety, accessibility, and transparency in the design process.

For the organization, my responsibility is to deliver solutions that align with its goals while maintaining integrity and professionalism. This means writing code that is maintainable, scalable, and free of intentional vulnerabilities. It also means being honest about limitations and potential risks so that decision-makers have the information they need to act responsibly.

Ultimately, my role is to balance innovation with accountability, ensuring that the work I produce benefits both the end user and the organization without compromising ethical standards.
